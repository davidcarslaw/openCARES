## Introduction

The **openCARES** R package contains tools to assist with the analysis of vehicle remote emission sensing data. The tools focus on the development of new insights from potentially complex data sets. This is anticipated to be useful for those working on the development of remote emission sensing technologies, in addition to end users such as city authorities, who want to better understand real-world emissions. The package has been developed under the framework of the City Air Remote Emission Sensing (CARES) project. For the main CARES website, see <https://cares-project.eu/>.

## Package installation

```{r}
if (!require('devtools')) install.packages('devtools')
devtools::install_github('davidcarslaw/openCARES')

```

## Summary analysis report

The goal of the CARES project is to reduce the hurdles for the practical application of remote emission sensing. The analysis of RES data can be challenging and within the community of researchers and practitioners that typically conduct experiments, there is a wide variation in the analysis approaches used and their consistency.

The main component of the `openCARES` package is the production of an **automated summary report**, which provides a quick and reliable way of presenting key summary data and plots from remote sensing measurement campaigns. End users can compile a report based on their own remote emission sensing data. The report provides details of measurement site conditions, vehicle fleet composition, and an evaluation of fuel-specific emission factors by vehicle type, fuel type, emission standard, manufacturer and so on. The effect of ambient temperature and vehicle deterioration on emissions is also explored.

The package aims to provide key summaries of emissions and the vehicle fleet that will typically be of common interest. All the analysis code is available in the package and can be modified and extended. The package contains an example data set from a remote sensing campaign conducted in 2021.

A summary of the fields available in the example data is given below:

```{r eval=TRUE}
library(openCARES)
dplyr::glimpse(rs_dat)
```

### Producing the summary report

The summary report was written in [Quarto](https://quarto.org), a system that enables a rich selection of outputs to be produced using R code as well as other programming languages such as Python. The easiest way to compile a report is to download a free version of the [RStudio IDE](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/), which recognises the Quarto format. The compiled report is an html document that can be opened in a browser. This choice of output was chosen in preference to pdf or Word because of the range of useful interactive capabilities available in html format. These capabilities make the investigation of remote sensing data engaging and informative, allowing the user to easily interrogate much of the data. The source file to test is available in the repository itself (/inst/[Summary-analysis.qmd](https://github.com/davidcarslaw/openCARES/blob/master/inst/Summary-analysis.qmd "Summary-analysis.qmd")). This file can easily be edited to change or extend the analysis undertaken using R code.

To produce an automated report using data other than that provided by the `openCARES` package requires that certain field names exist in the data set. A summary of the required fields is given in the compiled report [Summary-analysis](https://github.com/davidcarslaw/openCARES/blob/master/inst/Summary-analysis.qmd "Summary-analysis.qmd").html.
